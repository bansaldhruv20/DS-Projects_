This repository includes three distinct machine-learning projects. The Dog_Breed_Classification model uses Keras and TensorFlow to classify dog breeds from images, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy. The Password_Strength_Tester employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate and categorize the strength of passwords, enhancing online security with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The Stock_Market_Analysis project utilizes the ARIMA model to analyze stock market trends and predict future prices, providing valuable insights for investors through time series forecasting. Each project is designed to address specific real-world problems using advanced machine-learning techniques.
